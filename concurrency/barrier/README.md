# Barrier concurrency pattern
Its purpose is simpleâ€“put up a barrier so that
nobody passes until we have all the results we need, something quite common in
concurrent applications.

Imagine the situation where we have a microservices application where one service needs
to compose its response by merging the responses of another three microservices. This is
where the Barrier pattern can help us.
Our Barrier pattern could be a service that will block its response until it has been
composed with the results returned by one or more different Goroutines (or services). And
what kind of primitive do we have that has a blocking nature? Well, we can use a lock, but
it's more idiomatic in Go to use an unbuffered channel.

## Objectives
As its name implies, the Barrier pattern tries to stop an execution so it doesn't finish before
it's ready to finish. The Barrier pattern's objectives are as follows:
Compose the value of a type with the data coming from one or more Goroutines.
Control the correctness of any of those incoming data pipes so that no
inconsistent data is returned. We don't want a partially filled result because one
of the pipes has returned an error.

## An HTTP GET aggregator
For our example, we are going to write a very typical situation in a microservices
application-an app that performs two HTTP GET calls and joins them in a single response
that will be printed on the console.

Our small app must perform each request in a different Goroutine and print the result on
the console if both responses are correct. If any of them returns an error, then we print just
the error.

The design must be concurrent, allowing us to take advantage of our multicore CPUs to
make the calls in parallel.

## Acceptance criteria
Our main objective in this app is to get a merged response of two different calls, so we can
describe our acceptance criteria like this:
- Print on the console the merged result of the two calls to
http://httpbin.org/headers and http://httpbin.org/User-Agent URLs.
These are a couple of public endpoints that respond with data from the incoming
connections. They are very popular for testing purposes. You will need an
internet connection to do this exercise.
- If any of the calls fails, it must not print any result-just the error message (or error
messages if both calls failed).
- The output must be printed as a composed result when both calls have finished.
It means that we cannot print the result of one call and then the other.

## Wrap up the Barrier pattern
The Barrier pattern opens the door of microservices programming with its composable
nature. It could be considered a Structural pattern, as you can imagine.

The Barrier pattern is not only useful to make network requests; we could also use it to split
some task into multiple Goroutines. For example, an expensive operation could be split into
a few smaller operations distributed in different Goroutines to maximize parallelism and
achieve better performance.
