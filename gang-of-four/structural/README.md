# Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns, as the name implies, help us to shape our applications with commonly used structures and relationships.

-   [Adapter](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/gang-of-four/structural/adapter/README.md "Adapter Design Pattern in Go"). Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.
-   [Bridge](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/gang-of-four/structural/bridge/README.md "Bridge Design Pattern in Go"). Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.
-   [Composite](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/gang-of-four/structural/composite/README.md "Composite Design Pattern"). Takes a group of objects into a single object.
-   [Decorator](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/gang-of-four/structural/decorator/README.md "Decorator Pattern in Go"). Allows for an objectâ€™s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.
-   [Facade](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/gang-of-four/structural/facade/ "Facade Design Pattern in Go"). Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.
-   [Flyweight](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/gang-of-four/structural/flyweight/README.md "Flyweight Design Pattern in Go"). Reduces the cost of complex object models.
-   [Proxy](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/gang-of-four/structural/proxy/README.md "Proxy Design Pattern in Go"). Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.
