# Behavioral Patterns
The last group of common patterns we are going to see are the behavioral patterns. Now,
we aren't going to define structures or encapsulate object creation but we are going to deal
with behaviors.
What's to deal with in behavior patterns? Well, now we will encapsulate behaviors, for
example, algorithms in the Strategy pattern or executions in the command pattern.
Correct Behavior design is the last step after knowing how to deal with object creation and
structures. Defining the behavior correctly is the last step of good software design because,
all in all, good software design lets us improve algorithms and fix errors easily

-   [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/chain-of-responsibility/README.md "Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in Go"). Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
-   [Command](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/command/README.md "Command Design Pattern in Go"). Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
-   [Interpreter](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/interpreter/README.md "Interpreter Design Pattern in Go"). Implements a specialized language.
-   [Iterator](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/iterator/README.md "Iterator Design Pattern in Go"). Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
-   [Mediator](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/mediator/README.md "Mediator Design Pattern in Go"). Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
-   [Memento](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/memento/README.md "Memento Design Pattern in Go"). Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
-   [Observer](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/observer/README.md "Observer Design Pattern in Go"). Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
-   [State](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/state/README.md "State Design Pattern in Go"). Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
-   [Strategy](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/strategy/ "Strategy Design Pattern in Go"). Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.
-   [Template Method](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/template/README.md "Template Method Design Pattern in Go"). Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.
-   [Visitor](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/behavioral/visitor/README.md "Visitor Design Pattern in Go"). Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
