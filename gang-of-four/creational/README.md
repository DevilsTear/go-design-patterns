# Creational Patterns 
We have defined two types of cars-luxury and family. The car Factory will have to return
The first groups of design patterns that we are going to cover are the Creational patterns. As
the name implies, it groups common practices for creating objects, so object creation is more
encapsulated from the users that need those objects. Mainly, creational patterns try to give
ready-to-use objects to users instead of asking for their creation, which, in some cases, could
be complex, or which would couple your code with the concrete implementations of the
functionality that should be defined in an interface.

-   [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/tree/main/gang-of-four/creational/abstract-factory/ "Abstract Factory Design Pattern in Go"). Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.
-   [Builder](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/tree/main/gang-of-four/creational/builder/ "Builder Design Pattern in Go"). Uses to create complex objects.
-   [Factory Method](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/tree/main/gang-of-four/creational/factory/ "Factory Method Design Pattern in Go"). Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
-   [Prototype](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/tree/main/gang-of-four/creational/prototype/ "Prototype Design Pattern in Go"). Creates a new object from an existing object.
-   [Singleton](https://github.com/DevilsTear/go-design-patterns/tree/main/gang-of-four/creational/singleton/ "Singleton Design Pattern in Go"). Ensures only one instance of an object is created.
